# balena-labs-projects/browser

Provides a hardware accelerated web browser to present internal and external URLs on a connected display.
The `browser` block is a docker image that runs a [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser via X11, optimized for balenaOS.
The block provides an API for dynamic configuration, and also exposes the Chromium Remote Debug port.

## Features

- Chromium browser optimized for device arch
- Hardware video acceleration (if enabled)
- Optional KIOSK mode
- Remotely configurable launch URL
- Automatically displays local HTTP (port 80 or 8080) or HTTPS (443) service endpoints.
- API for remote configuration and management
- Chromium remote debugging port

## Usage

#### docker-compose file
To use this image, create a container in your `docker-compose.yml` file as shown below:

```yaml
version: '2'

volumes:
  settings:                          # Only required if using PERSISTENT flag (see below)

services:

  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-<arch> # where <arch> is one of aarch64, armv7hf or amd64
    privileged: true # required for UDEV to find plugged in peripherals such as a USB mouse
    ports:
        - '5011' # management API (optional)
        - '35173' # Chromium debugging port (optional)
    volumes:
      - 'settings:/data' # Only required if using PERSISTENT flag (see below)
```

To pin to a specific [version](CHANGELOG.md) of this block use:

```yaml
services:
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-<arch>/<version>
    privileged: true # required for UDEV to find plugged in peripherals such as a USB mouse
    ports:
        - '5011' # management API (optional)
        - '35173' # Chromium debugging port (optional)
    volumes:
      - 'settings:/data' # Only required if using PERSISTENT flag (see below)
```

## Customization
### Extend image configuration

By default the `browser` block uses the first local display (i.e. `DISPLAY=:0`) which would typically be a connected monitor, TV or a Pi Display. However for custom configurations you can overload the `CMD` directive, as such:

*dockerfile.template*
```Dockerfile
FROM bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-%%BALENA_ARCH%%

CMD ["export DISPLAY=:1"]
```

### Environment variables

The following environment variables allow configuration of the `browser` block:

| Environment variable | Options | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`LAUNCH_URL`|`http` or `https` URL|N\A|Web page to display|
|`DISPLAY_NUM`|`n`|0|Display number to use|
|`LOCAL_HTTP_DELAY`|Number (seconds)|0|Number of seconds to wait for a local HTTP service to start before trying to detect it|

## Choosing what to display
If you want the `browser` to display a website, you can set the `LAUNCH_URL` as noted above. However, you can also drop the `browser` into a multicontainer app, and use it to display the (HTTP, port 80 or 8080, or HTTPS port 443) output of another service, such as a Grafana dashboard. The `browser` will automatically detect that a service is running a HTTP server  and display that. Just make sure that you don't set a `LAUNCH_URL` environment variable, as they take precedence. Example:

*docker-compose.yml*
```yaml
version: '2.1'
volumes:
  settings:
services:
  browser:
    restart: always
    image: bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-<arch>
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - 'settings:/data'
  grafana:
    restart: always
    build: ./grafana
    ports:
      - "80"
```

## Choosing audio output device
By default the `browser` block will output audio via HDMI. If you want to route audio through a different interface you can do it with the help of the [`audio` block]((https://github.com/balena-labs-projects/audio)). The `browser` block is pre-configured to use it if present so you only need to add it to your `docker-compose.yml` file and then use `AUDIO_OUTPUT` environment variable to select the desired output. Check out the `audio` block [documentation](https://github.com/balena-labs-projects/audio#environment-variables) to learn more about it.

In this example we add the `audio` block and route the `browser` audio to the Raspberry Pi headphone jack:

```yaml
services:
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-<arch>
  audio:
    image: bh.cr/balenalabs/audio-<arch>
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - 4317:4317
    environment:
      AUDIO_OUTPUT: RPI_HEADPHONES
```

**Note**: The `browser` block expects the `audio` block to be named as such. If you change it's service name you'll need to override the `PULSE_SERVER` environment variable value to match it in the `browser` dockerfile. For example add `ENV PULSE_SERVER=tcp:not-audio:4317`.

## API
The `browser` block exposes an HTTP API running on port 5011. The following endpoints are available:

#### **GET** /ping
Returns HTTP 200 if the `browser` block is ready

#### **POST** /refresh
Refreshes the currently displayed page

#### **POST** /autorefresh/{interval}
Automatically refreshes the browser window

| Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | disable |
| 1-60 | refresh every `interval` seconds |

#### **POST** /scan
Re-scans the device to find local HTTP or HTTPS services to display. This can be used by the HTTP/S service to notify the `browser` block that it is ready to be displayed, should there be a startup race.

<small><b><i>note:</i></b> *the* `LAUNCH_URL` *must not be set for local services to be detected.*</small>

#### **GET** /url
Returns the URL currently being displayed

#### **PUT** /url
Sets the URL to be displayed. The URL is set in the request body. Example:

```bash
curl --data "url=www.balena.io" http://localhost:5011/url
```

You can also pre-set the kiosk and GPU settings as part of a URL put request. Example:

```bash
curl --data "url=www.balena.io&gpu=0&kiosk=1" http://localhost:5011/url
```

#### **GET** /gpu
Returns the status of the GPU:

| Return Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | disabled |
| 1 | enabled |

#### **PUT** /gpu/{value}
Enables or disables the GPU

| Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | disable |
| 1 | enable |

#### **GET** /kiosk
Returns whether the device is running kiosk mode or not:

| Return Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | disabled |
| 1 | enabled |

#### **PUT** /kiosk/{value}
Enables or disables kiosk mode

| Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 0 | disable |
| 1 | enable |

#### **GET** /flags
Returns the flags Chromium was started with

#### **GET** /version
Returns the version of Chromium that `browser` is running

#### **GET** /screenshot
Uses [scrot](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/taking-screen-captures-linux-command-line-scrot) to take a screenshot of the chromium window. 
The screenshot will be saved as a temporary file in the container.

## Troubleshooting
This section provides some guidance for common issues encountered:

#### Black border on HDMI display
Thanks to 1980's CRT televisions, manufacturers had to invent a method for cutting off the edges of a picture to ensure the "important" bits were displayed nicely on the screen. This is called `overscan` and there's a good article on it [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/252193/hdtv-overscan-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-probably-turn-it-off/).
If, when you plug one of the supported devices into your HDMI screen, you find black borders around the picture, you need to disable overscan. For the device this can be achieved by setting a [Device Configuration variable](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/configuration/#:~:text=Define%20fleet%2Dwide%3A-,Managing%20device%20configuration%20variables,of%20the%20device%20configuration%20variable.) called `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_disable_overscan` and setting the value to `1`:

![overscan-setting](https://i.ibb.co/sCQ8Dwy/Capture.jpg)

You may also need to turn it off on the screen itself (check your device instructions for details).

#### Partial/strange display output
Occasionally users report weird things are happening with their display output like:
* Only a portion of the browser screen appears on their display
* The screen is displaying skewed or fragmented
* Colors have changed dramatically

Here are some things to try:
* Setting the WINDOW_SIZE manually to your display's resolution (e.g. `1980,1080`) - the display may be mis-reporting it's resolution to the device
* Increase the memory being allocated to the GPU with the Device Configuration tab on the dashboard, or via [configuration variable](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/configuration/) - for large displays the device may need to allocate more memory to displaying the output
