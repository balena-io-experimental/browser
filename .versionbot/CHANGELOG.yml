    - subject: Update to Debian 11 and Node 16
      hash: 569be5de6d9296f08b636927694e915b5026c2bd
      body: |
        The block is currently based on Debian 10, however its mesa version
        is too old for RPi kernel 5.15.9 and up which results in X server
        crashing on startup.

        This patch updates the base to Debian 11 which seems to work fine.
        It also bumps node from 12 to 16 since 12 is quite old at this moment
        and not available for all the architectures in combination
        with Debian 11.

        balenaOS v2.83.6 enables user namespacing by default making applications
        such as chromium unable to run.

        We override the kernel parameter `user.max_user_namespaces` in the application as a workaround.
